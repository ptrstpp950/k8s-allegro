# Instructions

- open our app in browser (using one of the ways described before)
- check hostname (remember it)
- delete `dumpster-pod-*` pod, `*` is _randomly_(*) generated identification
- keep attention on the pod name (especially on `*` part) and pod `age`
- if nothing happens, good old `F5` will help ;)

(*) its not randomly generated. we will learn about it later.
